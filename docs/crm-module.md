The CRM module uses Redux Toolkit for state management with the following structure:

```typescript
interface CRMState {
  // Data
  leads: Lead[]
  contacts: Contact[]
  opportunities: Opportunity[]
  followUps: FollowUp[]
  statistics: CRMStatistics | null
  
  // UI State
  isLoading: boolean
  error: string | null
  
  // Filters and Pagination
  filters: CRMFilters
  currentPage: number
  totalPages: number
  totalItems: number
  
  // Selected Items
  selectedLead: Lead | null
  selectedContact: Contact | null
  selectedOpportunity: Opportunity | null
  
  // Modal States
  showLeadModal: boolean
  showContactModal: boolean
  showOpportunityModal: boolean
  showFollowUpModal: boolean
}
```

### API Integration

The CRM service layer provides comprehensive API integration:

```typescript
export const crmService = {
  // Lead Management
  getLeads(filters): Promise<{ data: Lead[]; total: number }>
  getLead(id): Promise<Lead>
  createLead(leadData): Promise<Lead>
  updateLead(id, leadData): Promise<Lead>
  deleteLead(id): Promise<void>
  convertLead(leadId, contactData): Promise<Contact>
  
  // Contact Management
  getContacts(filters): Promise<{ data: Contact[]; total: number }>
  getContact(id): Promise<Contact>
  createContact(contactData): Promise<Contact>
  updateContact(id, contactData): Promise<Contact>
  deleteContact(id): Promise<void>
  
  // Opportunity Management
  getOpportunities(filters): Promise<{ data: Opportunity[]; total: number }>
  getOpportunity(id): Promise<Opportunity>
  createOpportunity(opportunityData): Promise<Opportunity>
  updateOpportunity(id, opportunityData): Promise<Opportunity>
  deleteOpportunity(id): Promise<void>
  
  // Follow-up Management
  getFollowUps(contactId?): Promise<{ data: FollowUp[]; total: number }>
  getFollowUp(id): Promise<FollowUp>
  createFollowUp(followUpData): Promise<FollowUp>
  updateFollowUp(id, followUpData): Promise<FollowUp>
